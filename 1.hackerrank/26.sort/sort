# The vanilla sort command simply sorts the lines of the input file in lexicographical order.
# The -n option sorts the file on the basis of the numeric fields available if the first word or column in the file is a number.
# The -r option reverses the sorting order to either the reverse of the usual lexicographical ordering or descending order while sorting in numerical mode.
# The -k option is useful while sorting a table of data (tsv, csv etc.) based on a specified column (or columns).
# The -t option is used while specifying a delimiter in a particular file where columns are separated by tabs, spaces, pipes etc.

# sort input in numerical and discendig order:
sort -n -r
